    "It is a known fact backed up by data that the worldâ€™s population is currently increasing at an exponential rate. Many people worry that this could be a contributing factor to many global scale problems such as pollution, climate change, shortage of natural resources etc. My hypothesis is that even though population is increasing at the moment certain limiting factors will instead constrain population growth in such a way that the increase will begin to decelerate and eventually plateau in the next few decades. Such a growth is called logistic growth. The main limiting factors on population growth can include food, water, hospitable living space, and ability to recycle waste. However two major constraints on a country's population growth are its Development Index and Gross Domestic Product. These two factors and their effects on population growth will be analysed using data sets from https://www.gapminder.org/. In my analysis I will conduct a regression study in order to cast a future prediction on  population growth.     "

As HDI is a reletivley new statistc this data set is quite small similar to the GDP data set. In additon it does not contain data from every year up until the year 2005 so I will need to use interpolation to fill in the missing data. Like the other data sets it also contains a few NaN rows for various countries so it will require clever parsing and cleaning as well.\n",

This dataset came from the world bank data base https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG. Im hypothesising that countries with higher GDP will have lower birth rates than countries with lower industrial development indicators, hence we should see a negative correlation. The data contains one categorical attribute (country) and two quantitative (GDP and year). This data set tends to be quite sparse and only dates back to 1960 so an obvious reduction will be done when analysing these factors."

    "We've known for a fact now that the world population has been increasing since the early 18th century, In addition we also know that at present the rate of population growth is also increasing. However two major factors, Human Development Index and Gross Domestic Product, have shown to be correlated with these trends. Because most countries are still in the early stages of development we continue to see world population grow. However in this analysis weve seen that as there are obvious negative correlations between birthrate and and HDI as well as birthrate and GDP, and furthermore GDP and HDI are increasing for most countries around the world. Therefore weve reached the conclusion that, if these trends continue, then world population growth must eventually slow and eventually stabilize in the comming years.  "
