# Prediction of World Population and Contributing Factors
# Anthony Olvera

It is a known fact backed up by data that the worldâ€™s population is currently increasing at an exponential rate. Many people worry that this could be a contributing factor to many global scale problems such as pollution, climate change, shortage of natural resources etc. My hypothesis is that even though population is increasing at the moment certain limiting factors will instead constrain population growth in such a way that the increase will begin to decelerate and eventually plateau in the next few decades. Such a growth is called logistic growth. The main limiting factors on population growth can include food, water, hospitable living space, and ability to recycle waste. However two major constraints on a country's population growth are its Development Index and Gross Domestic Product. These two factors and their effects on population growth will be analysed using data sets from https://www.gapminder.org/. In my analysis I will conduct a regression study in order to cast a future prediction on population growth.
